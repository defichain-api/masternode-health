# Authenticating requests

Authenticate requests to this API's endpoints by sending a **`x-api-key`** header with the value **`"YOUR_API_KEY"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

Additionally you need to add the <code>x-server-key</code> header for a valid authentication.<br></br>For "how to create these credentials" take a look at the <b>Setup</b> section of this documentation.
