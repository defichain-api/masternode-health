# Introduction

The following endpoints are used for setup a server and to fetch the information for it. You need to use the bash script installed as cron on your server - you'll find it on https://github.com/defichain-api/masternode-health-server.

This documentation aims to provide all the information you need to work with our API.

<aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
You can switch the language used with the tabs at the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).</aside>
